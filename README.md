# SeaGAN
AI GAN model that generates images of the seawater surface with 512x896 resolution

I trained this model on Google Colab with premium GPU and I had nice results after 10000+ epochs.

This Google Colab notebook uses Google Drive to load train data and save checkpoints, so you need to upload this file (train data) on your Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zHQDn7fkXHJJyTMk_czvCPt60Le-0d6h/view?usp=share_link

Images dataset before converting to the train data (just to see): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10Re8X0JdndBR6f_QyGdXdGwG_y0oiOV7?usp=share_link
