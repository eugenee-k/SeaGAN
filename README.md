# SeaGAN
AI [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) model that generates images of the seawater surface with 896x512 resolution

I coded and trained this model on Google Colab with premium GPU and got nice results after 10000+ epochs.

The Google Colab notebook ([sea.ipynb](https://github.com/eugenee-k/SeaGAN/blob/main/sea.ipynb)) uses Google Drive to load train data and save checkpoints, so you need to upload this file (train data) into your Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zHQDn7fkXHJJyTMk_czvCPt60Le-0d6h/view?usp=share_link

Images dataset before converting to the train data (just to see): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10Re8X0JdndBR6f_QyGdXdGwG_y0oiOV7?usp=share_link
